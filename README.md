_Spend Tracking Web Application written using Google Apps Script_

The idea behind this is you want to track your spending habits using a few simple graphs and tables. All of your transactions are saved in a single Google Sheet "journal". Upload CSVs and Excel spreadsheets from your banks, credit card companies, etc. into this app and they get translated into canonical journal entries. The data is saved to your Google Drive so that you have complete control over it. Sharing data between users is the same as sharing the same journal and statements folder.

What makes GAS an interesting platform is how tightly integrated it is with the "Google Universe". So for things that deal with Google Docs, Sheets, etc. it is a natural fit. It doesn't work so well for external API's and there is no control over the URLs. I'll be curious to see if I can get this into working order enough to submit it to Google's publishing platform for apps.
